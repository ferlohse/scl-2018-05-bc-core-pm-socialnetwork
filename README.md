# Se-chat social network for avid readers who want to connect to others over shared experiences

We decided to create a community geared towards readers and those interested in bookish events, so that they might find said events much more easily and connect over what they love, or discover a new story.

Below we have outlined our market research, user testing and development process.

## Benchmarking:
Goodreads


## Business model:


Related advertising by other cultural sources,

Scalable:
Advertising revenue
Sponsored events
Sponsored book giveaways
Involvement with local and national reading initiatives


## UX Research

Target user: people who want to participate in book-related events


Target user interview questions:

1. Te gusta algún género en específico?
Escribes reseñas en algún lugar?
En qué forma te gusta leer? Física? Digital? audiobook?

2. Cómo encuentras qué leer? Cómo buscas algo más difícil de encontrar?
3. Participas en alguna comunidad, club o evento que tenga que ver con libros?
4. Te gusta prestar/ que te presten libros?
5. Cómo sueles conseguir libros? Digital/físicamente?
6. Te gustaría tener una red social de lectura? Si es así, qué te gustaría que tenga?

Sample interview:

Hi, thanks for agreeing to help me. These are the questions I need to ask, to figure out your social media usage, reading habits and what would interest you in a social network geared towards readers. It won’t take more than an hour and it will be used to help our research and development process.

Do you use any social networks or chat apps? Which ones? How often?

I use the following:

  * Signal (as my text message app, rarely for its security features).
  * Wire (daily)
  * WhatsApp (daily)
  * Slack (daily)
  * LinkedIn (weekly)

How often do you read for pleasure?

I aim for every night. This does not always happen.

Is there a particular genre you like? Why?

Fantasy because I am reading for escapism. I also like to read sci-fi
for the same reason. I do occasionally read crime novels, non-fiction,
biographies and sometimes classics, depending on my mood.

Do you leave book reviews online?

Very rarely. However I do read what is written on goodreads sometimes.

What book format do you prefer? Physical? Digital? Audiobook?

Physical is much, much better than digital.
When a digital format exists, I prefer DRM-free digital books.
The presence of DRM is a dealbreaker for me (or I find ways to remove it).

How do you go about finding what to read next? How do you look for
things that are more difficult to find?

Amazon recommended lists, reviews, suggestions from friends/colleagues
etc, Basically whenever I run out, I go hunting for new series. However,
I tend to have the problem that I am waiting for the completion of
existing series as well.

How do you buy books? Online? Bookshops? Or do you prefer borrowing them
from friends/libraries?

I mostly buy books online from a number of places: Amazon, UK retailers
like Waterstones, and Swiss/French such as Payot/Fnac/Orell Füssli.

I rarely borrow from friends, but I do borrow/exchange with family.

Do you participate in any book-related communities/clubs/events?

Not really.

Would you participate in a book-related social network? If so, what
would you like to see in it, in terms of features?

Yes. I think several features would be really cool to have:

  1. Reviews based on stars are a bit arbitrary, because my 5 star might
be your 3. Perhaps it would be an idea to have a limited number of 5
stars to give out. (Perhaps you could earn more for reviewing books). I
also think perhaps some kind of system to normalize reviews would be
helpful:

     1. Did not enjoy this book and would not recommend.
     2. OK book, but didn't quite meet expectations.
     3. A solid book for this genre.
     4. A standout book for this genre. Readers of the genre should read
this at some point.
     5. One of my all time favourites.

  2. A clear way to see and track series/trilogies of books, including
unpublished works. Likewise for authors. A clear way to see my
unfinished trilogies.

  3. Exports of that data.

  4. Features I don't use from goodreads: a ton of shelves (tags would
be cool though, so users on my profile can also break my books down by
tags). Reading status (the point of reading is NOT to be on a computer,
it is escapism, so I rarely update when I start or finish books. I use
it to track what I have read).

  5. I think authors should have an easy way to update their audiences,
but this should be a clearly marked stream (separate to friends, so I
know what's what and I'm not lost in a sea of updates).

Excellent, this has been very informative. Thanks again for taking the time!


## Development process and design decisions:

We started with deciding on the features we wanted our social network to have and prioritising them according to the time and estimated difficulty. Then we picked a name and colour scheme (Seshat, Egyptian goddess of wisdom, and purple, the colour of wisdom.)
We decided to integrate our Login with both Google and Facebook using Firebase.
After that, we began fleshing out the functionalities and writing the tests for them,  and testing as we went that things were working as they are supposed to.

Organisation-wise, we turned to pen and paper initially, but once we had the main structure more or less defined, we used a Trello board to keep track of what we needed to do.
